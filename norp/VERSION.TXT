NORP Version History

Version 0.1b8
=============
    - Improved NAT traversal by using single NORM tx/rx socket

Version 0.1b6
=============
    - Added Visual Studio project files for Windows builds
      (Thanks to Sam Rhody of John Hopkins APL)
    - Fixed code that poorly assumed that zero bytes read from 
      a ProtoSocket(TCP) meant the connection had ended. Fixed
      related Window ProtoSocket(TCP) issue to make sure socket
      close events are reported properly.

Version 0.1b3
=============
    - Added "correspondent <remoteNorpAddr>" command to allow 'routing'
      of proxied connections through specified remote 'norp' peer
      instead of directly to connection destination address.
    - Includes fix to NORM source code of receiver rate estimation
      measured during 'slow start' phase of congestion control

Version 0.1b2
=============
    - Adopted NORM_SYNC_STREAM policy to guarantee synchronization
      of stream start at byte offset zero of proxied TCP stream data
    - Added norp "persist" command-line option to allow control of how
      persistently norp tries to deliver TCP data in disruptive network
      environments.  A -1 persistence value is infinitely persistent.
      The default persistence is 120 seconds (2 minutes).

Version 0.1b1
=============
    - Fixed bugs with "forward" command recently added
    - Updated "norm" with bug fix in normSession.cpp

Version 0.1
=============
    - Started versioning
    - This version adds the "forward" command for non-SOCKS proxying
